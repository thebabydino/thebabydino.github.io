I code stuff. I'm a showoff, so I sometimes record myself doing it.</p><p>I've never been good with words. My mom wrote all my compositions in school so I wouldn't fail literature. This short paragraph took me hours to write. My thoughts aren't made up of words, but of visuals. I see numbers arranged in space, geometric shapes, various images of the past. So everything I make is very visual as well.</p><p>Got a small coding project? Hire me! You can do so by sending an email to vtib@protonmail.com. Note that you need to type out the email, copy-pasting won't work. Also note that nothing that's not within the realm of what I do will get forwarded to me. You can see work samples below.</p><h3>Styled range inputs</h3><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76854602/161434400-ca04f4da-cd39-43ca-88f9-08d1f05d1580.png"></section></main><footer><p>tigers are kitties</p></footer></body></html>
